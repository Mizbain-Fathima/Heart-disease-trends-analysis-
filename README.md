Heart Disease Trends Analysis

Predicting Heart Disease Risk with Machine Learning

Overview

This project develops a predictive model to determine the risk of heart disease based on various factors. The model takes input parameters such as age, gender, blood pressure, and more to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

Features

- Predictive model using machine learning algorithms
- Input parameters: age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more
- Output: High or Low risk of heart disease
- Web application or API deployment

Usage

1. Provide input parameters through the web application or API
2. Receive output indicating High or Low risk of heart disease

Dataset

- The dataset used for training and testing is available in the data directory

Model

- The trained machine learning model is available in the models/ directory
- Model algorithm: Decision tree
